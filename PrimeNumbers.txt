Finding if prime number:

a. we divide it by 2
b1. if is perfectly divided is not prime = answer not prime
b2. if is not perfectly divided we forget about the numbers that are bigger than quotient (cat)
c. we divide with the next number
d1. if is perfectly divided si not prime = answer not prime
d2. if is not perfectly divided we forget about the numbers that are bigger than the new quotient (cat)
e. we repeat the process until we try to divide all numbers that count
