Problem Name: Sort Numbers

Step 1: Understand the problem

  We had many numbers, we have to arrange all the numbers in ascending orders. 
  
  Step 2: Formulate the model
  
  << We compare the numbers and see which one is the smallest and swap it with the first one, now the first number is sorted.
  We take the 2nd number and compare it with the other unsorted numbers and swap it with the smallest unsorted number, now we have 2 sorted 
  numbers. We take the 3rd number and compare it with the other unsorted numbers and swap it with the smallest unsorted number, now we have
  3 sorted numbers. We take the 4th number and compare it with the other number and swap it if it is smaller than the 4th number, now we 
  have 5 sorted numbers. >>
  
  a. Select the first number
  b. Compare it with the next numbers numbers and find which one is the smallest.
  c. Now select the smaller number and compare it with the next. Find which one is smaller.
  d. Repeat this step until the end of all numbers. This way will know which is the smallest number.
  e. Replace the smallest number with the first number of the series.
  f. Forget about the first number and start the process with the next number. Until we finish the whole list.
