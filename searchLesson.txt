Linear search:

a. select the firsat number
b. compare the number with the others
c [variant 1]. if is not equal then go on to the next number and compare it
c [variant 2]. if is equal then you stop ( and maybe celebrate that you found it :) )



Binary search:

a. Find the middle pos. of the list
b. Compare the number in the middle with the list
c [variant 1]. if the number is equal to the search number, then exit
c [variant 2]. if number is > than search number repeat step a and b for the first half
c [variant 3]. if number is < than search number repeat step a and b for the second half



Find prime number:
a. Divide number by 2
b. Check if rest = 0 or not
c [variant 1]. if rest = 0 exit : number is not prime
c [variant 2]. if rest innot equal to zero repeat step a and b by adding 1 to the previous number 
d. If we reach the original number than number is prime number
